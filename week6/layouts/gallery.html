				<p>Changes last year in how Facebook shared information meant that 
simply hiding your name from search really didn't do much to keep you from

still not find you in search.How to Stay (Mostly) Hidden What Facebook 
would like you to do, and what is arguably safer anyway, is to use more 
fine-grained controls for who sees what you post.  Facebook has some quick 
links to some of these controls in the upper right of each page, accessible
by clicking the padlock icon. Here you can quickly adjust</P>
